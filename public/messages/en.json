Deliveries are made exclusively within the European Union.</li><li>2.3. The contract language is German.</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">3. Conclusion of Contract<ol><li>3.1. The online presentation of NXpower GmbH merely represents a sales brochure. The presentation of products by NXpower GmbH allows you to submit a request/offer to order.</li><li>3.2. When ordering through our online shop, the ordering process comprises four steps. In the first step, you select the desired goods. In the second step, you enter your customer data including billing address and, if applicable, different delivery address. In the third step, you choose how you want to pay. In the last step, you have the opportunity to review all details (e.g., name, address, payment method, ordered items) and possibly correct them before you submit your order by clicking 'Buy Now'.</li><li>3.3. Upon receipt of your order at NXpower GmbH, you will receive a confirmation email sent to the email address you provided, stating that your order has been received and is being processed. The customer must ensure that the email address provided is correct so that emails sent by NXpower GmbH can be received at this address. The order confirmation is not yet the acceptance of your request/offer to conclude a purchase. It is merely for the information of the order receipt. A purchase contract is only concluded after written confirmation by NXpower GmbH. For this, you will receive a separate purchase confirmation from NXpower GmbH.</li><li>3.4. We store the contract text and send you the order data, our General Terms and Conditions, and the cancellation policy by email. You can view your past orders in our customer login area if you have registered with us as a customer.</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">4. Prices/Costs<ol><li>4.1. The prices at the time of the order apply. All prices include the statutory value-added tax applicable in Germany.</li><li>4.2. When delivering to countries outside Germany, additional taxes, duties, and/or costs may arise, which are not included in the prices. The customer must bear these additional costs.</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">5. Shipping Costs<ol><li>5.1. Shipping costs per order for complete PC systems are free within Germany and Austria, shipping costs per order outside Germany and Austria for complete PC systems are €25.</li><li>5.2.

Unless otherwise stated in the offer, we ship the goods within 7 working days after receipt of payment. For delivery on account or payment by direct debit, we ship the goods, unless otherwise stated in the offer, within 7 working days after delivery of the order confirmation.</li><li>6.2. Unless otherwise specified, delivery is made to the delivery address you have specified.</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">7. Payment Methods<br>The customer has the option to choose between the following payment methods: Transfer (prepayment), payment by cash on delivery (only in Germany), PayPal, Sofortueberweisung.de, or cash payment upon pickup.</li><li class=\"title\">8. Retention of Title<br>The delivered goods remain the property of NXpower GmbH until full payment has been made by the customer.</li><li class=\"title\">9. Warranty for Defects<ol><li>9.1. The statutory warranty rights apply.</li><li>9.2. In the case of rectification/replacement delivery, NXpower GmbH acquires ownership of the removed/replaced components/devices. For production and for rectification/replacement delivery, NXpower GmbH uses spare parts or components that are new or as good as new according to the usual industrial standard. The further legal claims of the buyer remain unaffected.</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">10. Limitation Period for Warranty Claims<br>If you purchase goods as a business owner (§ 14 BGB), any warranty claims for new and used goods expire one year after the transfer of risk.</li><li class=\"title\">11. Battery Regulation In connection with the distribution of batteries or accumulators, or with the delivery of devices that contain batteries or accumulators, we are obliged according to the battery regulation to point out the following:<ol><li>1. Batteries and accumulators can be returned free of charge at the point of sale after use.</li><li>2. The end user is obliged to return used batteries and accumulators.<br></li><li>3. The significance of the symbol §17 paragraph 1 and the characters after §17 paragraph 3.<br></li></ol>The symbols are mercury (Hg) if more than 0.0005 percent by mass, cadmium (Cd) if more than 0.002 percent by mass cadmium, and lead (Pb) if more than 0.004 percent by mass lead.<ol><li>- Disposal of old batteries via household waste is legally prohibited</li><li>- Help us protect our environment from harmful pollution</li><li>- Please return your old batteries for disposal at the point of sale</li></ol></li><li class=\"title\">12. Final Provisions If the customer is a business owner, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the seat of our company is agreed as the exclusive place of jurisdiction. The same applies if the customer does not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany, if his place of residence or usual abode is not known at the time of filing a lawsuit.</li><li>NXpower GmbH<br>Managing Director: Mei-Ling Yeh<br>Bischofstr. 80<br>D-47809 Krefeld<br><br>Court of Registration: Krefeld<br>Commercial Register No.: 14329<br><br>Email:<a href=\"mailto:info@coolpc.de\">info@coolpc.de</a><br>WEB: www.coolpc.de<br><br>Phone: +49–(0)2151–51 889 51<br>Fax: +49 (2151) 51889 - 28<br></li></ol>",

If score values are included in the credit report result, they are based on a scientifically recognized mathematical-statistical procedure, with address data being included in the calculation of the score values. For the purpose of identity verification, your personal data will be transmitted to one of the above credit agencies. The credit agency then provides a percentage match of the personal details stored with them to the data you provided and may include a note on a previously conducted ID check at the credit agency. PayPal can thus determine from the transmitted match rates whether a person with the details you provided is stored in the credit agency's database.
